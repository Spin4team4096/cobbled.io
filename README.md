# cobbled.io
This is the client code for my upcoming game, cobbled.io, which you can play at https://spin4team4096.github.io/cobbled.io/cobbled.io-client.html

The purpose is to port my PenguinMod game, "cobbled.io", and rewrite it in html + javascript, while also adding multiplayer!
It's still in early development (so not fully playable and is missing a lot of features), but you can try a singleplayer demo here: https://studio.penguinmod.com/#0678740308
